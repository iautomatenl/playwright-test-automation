# Playwright Automated Testing Framework for Thinkwise Testwise

## Project Description

This Playwright project is an automated testing framework specifically designed to support the Thinkwise Testwise platform. It enables efficient and reliable end-to-end testing of Thinkwise applications by leveraging Playwright's capabilities for cross-browser automation.

The framework provides a robust structure for writing, organizing, and executing UI tests that validate the functionality, performance, and user experience of Thinkwise Testwise projects. It incorporates best practices such as the Page Object Model pattern, test fixtures, and parallel test execution to ensure scalability and maintainability.

By automating repetitive testing tasks, this framework helps reduce manual effort, accelerate release cycles, and improve overall software quality within the Thinkwise development lifecycle.
